  "subject": "Maintenance Discrepancy Report - Landing Gear B Hydraulic Failure",
  "content": "Dear Maintenance Control/Engineering Team,\n\nI am submitting a Maintenance Discrepancy Report (MDR) for an issue noted on **August 2nd, 2025**, during a pre-flight check on **Landing Gear B**. \n\nThe defect is logged under the operational system as **MAINT-LG-20250802-002**.\n\n**Observed Discrepancy (Equipment: Landing Gear B):**\n\nThe primary concern is a **Hydraulic failure** resulting in a slow response time during the gear swing test. Initial observation shows a noticeable drop in hydraulic system pressure specifically impacting the operation of the Landing Gear B retraction/extension sequence.\n\n**Action Taken/Request (Required Procedure: Inspect hydraulic lines and refill fluid):**\n\nThe aircraft is currently grounded pending repair. I have applied a **red maintenance tag** to the landing gear lever.\n\nI kindly request immediate attention to this issue. The required procedure is to **Inspect all hydraulic lines** associated with Landing Gear B for potential leaks or structural damage, followed by a system **refill and bleed** to restore correct fluid levels and pressure. Please dispatch a hydraulic specialist with the appropriate tools and fluid stock.\n\n**Contact Information:**\n\n**Aircraft Location:** Hangar 4, West Apron\n**Contact Name:** Michael Chen, Senior Airframe Technician\n**Phone:** (555) 333-1111\n**Email:** michael.chen@airmaint.com\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this safety-critical matter. We require the Landing Gear to pass a full operational test prior to the aircraft's next scheduled flight.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael Chen\nSenior Airframe Technician"
