  "content": "Dear Maintenance Control/Engineering Team,\n\nI am submitting a Maintenance Discrepancy Report (MDR) for an issue noted on **January 2nd, 2024**, during the post-flight inspection of **Aircraft A320**, registration number **N123AA** (Tail Number). \n\nThis discrepancy was observed following arrival from **Flight 456 (Route: KLAX to KSFO)**. The defect is logged under the operational system as **MAINT-A320-20240102-001**.\n\n**Observed Discrepancy:**\n\nDuring the walk-around, the **No. 1 Engine Cowling** was noted to have a **minor structural dent** on the **lower aft section**, approximately **3:30 PM** local time. The damage appears consistent with possible **Foreign Object Damage (FOD)** that may have occurred during the previous pushback or taxi operation. There are no immediate fluid leaks or visible damage to the engine fan blades or surrounding structure, but the dent exceeds the **Category B (Minor Repair)** limit as per the Structural Repair Manual (SRM).\n\n**Action Taken/Request:**\n\nI have immediately grounded the aircraft and applied a **temporary placard** to the affected area. I have also taken **high-resolution photographs** of the damage, noting its exact location (Reference **Station 456, Stringer 12**).\n\nI kindly request that a **certified technician** be dispatched to perform a detailed **Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) inspection** of the affected cowling and the underlying engine mount structure to confirm airworthiness and determine the required permanent repair (either blend-out or panel replacement).\n\n**Contact Information:**\n\nPlease contact me for access to the aircraft's logbook or for any further details required for the immediate repair action. \n\n**Aircraft Location:** Gate B25, San Francisco International Airport (KSFO).\n**Contact Name:** Alex Johnson, Lead Line Technician\n**Phone:** (555) 987-6543\n**Email:** alex.johnson@airmaintain.com\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this safety-critical matter. We look forward to receiving the necessary work order and technical guidance to return the aircraft to service (RTS).\n\nSincerely,\nAlex Johnson\nLead Line Technician\nKSFO Maintenance Base"
