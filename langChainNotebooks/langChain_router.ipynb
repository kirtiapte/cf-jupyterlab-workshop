       "'**Black‑body radiation** is the electromagnetic radiation that a perfect absorber (a *black body*) emits solely because it has a temperature.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### What a black body is  \\n* Imagine an object that **absorbs 100\\u202f% of any light that hits it**, no matter the wavelength.  \\n* In thermal equilibrium that object must also **emit** radiation.  \\n* The emitted spectrum depends **only on its temperature**, not on its material, shape, or surface texture. Real objects can approximate this behavior (e.g., a cavity with a tiny hole, the Sun, incandescent filaments).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### The emitted spectrum  \\n\\n| Property | What it tells you |\\n|----------|-------------------|\\n| **Planck’s law** (1900) | Gives the intensity \\\\(I(\\\\lambda,T)\\\\) at wavelength \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) for a temperature \\\\(T\\\\):  <br> \\\\[\\nI(\\\\lambda,T)=\\\\frac{2hc^{2}}{\\\\lambda^{5}}\\\\;\\\\frac{1}{\\\\exp\\\\!\\\\bigl(\\\\frac{hc}{\\\\lambda k_{B}T}\\\\bigr)-1}\\n\\\\] <br> This curve is smooth, peaks at a certain wavelength, and falls off at both short and long wavelengths. |\\n| **Stefan–Boltzmann law** | The total power per unit area emitted is \\\\(\\\\displaystyle j^{\\\\star}= \\\\sigma T^{4}\\\\) (σ ≈\\u202f5.67\\u202f×\\u202f10⁻⁸\\u202fW\\u202fm⁻²\\u202fK⁻⁴). hotter bodies glow dramatically brighter. |\\n| **Wien’s displacement law** | The wavelength at which the spectrum peaks moves inversely with temperature: <br> \\\\(\\\\lambda_{\\\\text{max}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2.90\\\\times10^{-3}\\\\,\\\\text{m·K}}{T}\\\\). <br> So a 300\\u202fK object peaks near 10\\u202fµm (infrared), while a 6000\\u202fK star peaks around 0.5\\u202fµm (visible green). |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Why it matters  \\n\\n* **Thermodynamics & quantum physics** – Planck’s law was the first successful quantum description of radiation; it resolved the “ultraviolet catastrophe” predicted by classical physics.  \\n* **Practical uses** – Determining temperatures of stars, designing infrared detectors, calibrating instruments, and understanding the cosmic microwave background (which is an almost perfect black‑body spectrum at 2.73\\u202fK).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### In a nutshell  \\n\\nA black body is an idealized perfect absorber that, when warm, radiates a **characteristic, temperature‑only spectrum** described by Planck’s law. The total emitted power grows as \\\\(T^{4}\\\\), and the peak wavelength shifts to shorter values as the temperature rises. This simple model underlies much of modern physics and many everyday technologies.'"
